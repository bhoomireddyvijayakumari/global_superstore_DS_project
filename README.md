-> Project 1 – General EDA:

1. Cleaned dataset by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and addressing outliers.

2. Visualized sales and profit distributions.

3. Detected skewness and high-value outliers.

4. Found a strong positive correlation between Sales and Profit.


-> Project 2 – Sales Performance Analysis:

1. Analyzed time trends in sales: found seasonal peaks.

2. Discovered negative correlation between discount and profit.

3. Compared sales performance across regions and categories.

4.Built a Linear Regression model to predict sales:
