Project 1 – General EDA:

Cleaned dataset by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and addressing outliers.

Visualized sales and profit distributions.

Detected skewness and high-value outliers.

Found a strong positive correlation between Sales and Profit.


Project 2 – Sales Performance Analysis:

Analyzed time trends in sales: found seasonal peaks.

Discovered negative correlation between discount and profit.

Compared sales performance across regions and categories.

Built a Linear Regression model to predict sales:

Initially used only Profit and Discount.

Later enhanced with more features and preprocessing, improving R² score significantly.
